# Water-quality-Monitoring-using-IoT

In our project we aimed to predict the portability of water(drinkability of water)usingthe
pH, Turbidity and Conductivity as our based at a on which we predicted the portability.This
ideas sprouted because of the health issues and deaths happening throughout the world
because of the water pollution which might be purely and unknowingly or irresponsible
blunder.As this pollution may happen at any given point of treatment of the water because
of industrial wastes.Sothisproblemcanbeovertakenby This Proposed Idea.In The Proposal
We are willing to predict water quality and send mail about water quality parameters.
We also developed a mobile app where users can check the details of water quality through
map. Totally,we expect this system to prevent any health hazards to people and does not
require people on duty.The system is likely to be More Economical,convenient,fastand
portable.
